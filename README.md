# 🐍 Python Daily Practice

This repository is my personal space to practice and improve my Python skills every day.  
The goal is **consistent learning, problem-solving, and building small projects**.

## ✅ How to Use This Repo

1. Each day’s practice will be in a folder named `day-XX`.
2. Inside each folder:  
   - `notes.md` → theory & notes  
   - `practice.py` → exercises  
   - `project.py` (if any mini-project)
